{"name":"Resistome.GitHub.io","tagline":"The Resistome","body":"### Welcome to the Resistome Repository!\r\nThe Resistome is a manually curated database that aims to collect all known *Escherichia coli* genotypes that confer resistance to chemicals and environmental conditions into a standardized, easily analyzed central repository. To analyze these data, we offer a range of Python-based software tools for data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning to help researchers contextualize their experiments better. As for February 2016, the Resistome contains over 5,000 *E. coli* strains, resisting ~230 conditions, which are curated from 301 papers. A preliminary draft of our analysis can be found here (link to be added).\r\n\r\n###Why is the Resistome necessary?\r\nThe microbial ability to tolerate stressful environmental conditions and chemical inhibitors is of great industrial and medical importance: metabolic engineers seek to design microbes that can tolerate commonly encountered stresses in the course of fermentation (acids, furans, osmolytes), while the specter of broadening antibiotic resistance threatens a return to a “pre-antibiotic era” of mostly untreatable infectious diseases. Stress resistance has been studied extensively in both contexts for many years, yet much of the data related to genetically-acquired stress resistance is scattered through the academic literature and many databases, making it difficult to apply systematic analyses to this wealth of information. The Resistome is designed to directly address these issues by providing a centralized repository for resistance related data, as well as analysis and visualization tools to help researchers discover ways to slow the acquisition of dangerous drug resistance traits, and help engineers construct strains more suitable for industrial fermentation.\r\n\r\n### Tool Summary\r\nSeveral libraries have been created or adapted to simplify Resistome data analysis. Here are some of these tools that we have found to be the most useful when analyzing resistance genotypes:\r\n*Data Visualization: bar charts, heat maps, line plots, line/bar plots, stacked bar plots, scatter plots, histograms and CDF charts, Circos maps, and network visualization. Most of the utility functions use @Matlibplot as their base.\r\n*Statistical analyses: hypergeometric tests to compare list overlaps, FDR tests for analyzing gene ontology enrichment.\r\n*Machine Learning: Recommender system for comparing genotype feature vectors, graph clustering interfances between NetworkX and igraph. Mostly implemented within Numpy, Scipy, NetworkX, and igraph.\r\n*Parsing, data entry, and standardization utilities: parser grammars for each Resistome object (Paper, Mutant, Mutation) and their associated parsers, a simple local data entry tool for enforcing standardized curation, interfaces to the [(Biocyc databases)](biocyc.org) to convert gene names to accession numbers, a Standardization class to transparently map input-to-standard text conversions.\r\nThis list is not comprehensive; please take a look at our paper on biorxiv or the repository documentation to get a more complete overview of Resistome software.\r\n\r\n###Who are we?\r\n*James Winkler [(gs)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Xkkj8kAAAAJ&hl=en, james.winkler@gmail.com)  was a post-doctoral research associate at CU-Boulder (PI: Ryan Gill) and is the lead developer of the Resistome.
